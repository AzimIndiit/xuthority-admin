## Technical Implementation

### Admin Integration

## Routes Integration

## File Structure
```
xuthority-admin/src/
├── components/
│   └── common/
│       └── ResourceCard.tsx (new)
├── pages/
│   └── admin/
│       └── ResourceCenterPage.tsx (new)
└── routes/
    └── index.tsx (updated)
```

## Cleanup
The implementation was initially created in the wrong project (`xuthority-dev`) and has been properly moved to `xuthority-admin`. All traces from the dev project have been cleaned up.

The implementation is complete and ready for use within the admin dashboard. The page loads at `/resource-center` and matches the exact design specifications from the provided image while being properly integrated into the admin panel architecture.
